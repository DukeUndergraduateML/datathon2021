# datathon2021: Asian Barometer Survey (ABS)

This repository contains information for Datathon2021, which is on the Asian Barometer Survey (ABS), where extensive information can be found here at

## What is the mission of the ABS?

The ABS has three main objectives, which we repeat exactly from their webpage to help student understand their mission.

1. ``To generate a region-wide base of scientifically reliable and comparable data."

``Public opinion data on issues such as political values, democracy, governance, human security, and economic reforms were gathered through face-to-face interviews with randomly-selected pools of respondents that represent the adult population of the country in question. By insisting on strict research standards, we seek to ensure that are data is trustworthy and accurate."

2. ``To strengthen intellectual and institutional capacity for research on democracy."

``The network fosters mutual exchange of expertise by bringing partners and scholars together for planning and analysis at the national, continental, and global levels."


3. ``To disseminate survey results to academics and policy circles."

``We continually strive for the consistent presentation of our survey results. Using the Globalbarometer Survey (GBS) report as our model, we distribute our data to a wide variety of individuals and organizations, including decision makers in legislative and executive branches of government, policy advocates and civic educators, journalists, academic researchers, international investors, and NGOs concerned with democratic development."

## Question of Interest 1: ABS, Waves 1 and Waves 2

Given one of the motivating questions of interest, build a predictive model for at least one wave to help the ABS' objective. Be sure to conduct an exploratory data analysis, choose a model that is appropriate for the data at hand, and explain any assumptions that you make. In building your model, be sure to pay attention to the priority variables in the documentation folders. 

Suggestions regarding talking points and plans of work:

0. Choose a group leader, especially that might have experience with this type of data. 
1. Perform an exploratory data analysis such that you understand what type of data you have. Is it continuous, discrete, categorical, or mixed? Given the data, what types of models are appropriate? 
2. Start out in a simple way. For example, start with wave 1 and with one country to get a feel for the data set before generalizing. 
3. Choose simple models before overly complex models (and make sure that these models are appropriate for the data). Be sure to account for missingness of any data in a statistically sound way. 
4. What conclusions and guidance can you provide to the ABS for future guidance? 
5. Be sure to include your code in your report.
